# Static Style Loader

[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v0.1-blue)](https://github.com/wp-cologne/static-style-loader/releases/download/v0.1/static-style-loader.zip) Installable WordPress Plugin

**Static Style Loader** is a lightweight preservation plugin designed to keep Automatic.css (ACSS) styles active on your website after the original ACSS plugin has been deactivated or removed. 

It works by enqueuing the generated CSS files that remain in your WordPress uploads directory (`/wp-content/uploads/automatic-css/`).


## Features
* **Zero Configuration:** Just install and activate.
* **Gutenberg Ready:** Loads `automatic-gutenberg.css` for block editor compatibility.
* **Bricks Builder Support:** Detects Bricks and loads specific builder-UI styles (`automatic-bricks-in-builder.css`) only when the editor is active.
* **Lightweight:** No database queries, no settings page. Just loads the CSS.

## ⚠️ Critical Safety Requirement

Since this plugin loads files directly from your uploads folder:
**DO NOT delete the folder `/wp-content/uploads/automatic-css/` on your server!**

When deleting the original ACSS plugin, ensure that it does not clean up/delete these files during the uninstallation process. It is highly recommended to **make a backup** of this folder via FTP before deleting the original plugin.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Generated CSS Files:** The ACSS files must exist in `wp-content/uploads/automatic-css/`.
2.  **PHP 7.4+**

## Installation

1.  Download the `.zip` file from the link above.
2.  In your WordPress Admin, go to **Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin**.
3.  Select the downloaded zip file and click **Install Now**.
4.  **Activate** the plugin.
5.  Deactivate and remove the original Automatic.css plugin.
6.  Check your frontend to ensure styles are loading correctly.

## How it works

The plugin registers and enqueues the following stylesheets if they exist in your uploads directory:
* `automatic-variables.css` (Colors & Root variables)
* `automatic.css` (Core Framework)
* `automatic-bricks.css` (Bricks specific fixes)
* `automatic-custom-css.css` (Your custom overrides)
* `automatic-gutenberg.css` (Gutenberg/Block Editor styles)

## License

* **Plugin Code:** GPLv2 or later.
* **CSS Files:** The CSS files generated by ACSS are your property to use on your site (GPL).

**Note:** This plugin does not allow you to generate *new* styles or change settings. It only preserves the "frozen" state of your design at the moment ACSS was removed.
